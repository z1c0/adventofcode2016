## Day11

That's ... almost **8 hours**. Not proud of it  ðŸ˜¬.

## Day 19

Part 2 was a real challenge.
The first approach using a `LinkedList` had worked fine for *Part 1* but showed
dismal performance now.

Elf 1407007 gets all (3001330) the presents.
END (after 26696.1142087 seconds)
```

Again, .. more than **7 hours** ðŸ˜¬.

The problem was the linear search for locating an element in the list that caused
an `O(nÂ²)` complexity. My solution was a custom data structure I called
`BucketList` (haha) which maintains the elements in a list of lists that have the
same maximum size ("buckets"). This way I brought the runtime down dramatically,
because instead of linear I have mostly `O(1)` lookups to elements.

> Note: A bucket size of `25.000` worked best in my case but your mileage may vary, of course.

```txt

```

**17 seconds** ... way better ðŸ¤©.

## Day 22

```txt
...
Goal reached after 271 steps
Goal reached after 269 steps
Goal reached after 267 steps
Goal reached after 265 steps
Goal reached after 263 steps
Goal reached after 261 steps
END (after 3245.6201707 seconds)
```

54 minutes ... meh ... good enough.
